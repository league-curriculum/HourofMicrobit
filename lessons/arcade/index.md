# Arcade

You can program video games on your Microbit, using specialized hardware that looks like a portable game console. We will be using three different consoles.

This device is a controller and screen for a Micro:bit; you will need to have a microbit to plug into it.

This handheld console looks a lot like the one your parents played as kids, but it has a Micro:bit inside of it. 


## Kittenbot Meowbit

The Meowbit is also a Micro:bit with a screen and buttons, but it also has a
connector under the white cover, so you can plug it into robots like a
regular Microbit. 

## Programming the Arcade

To Program these devices, you will need a different version of Makecode, [Makecode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com).
