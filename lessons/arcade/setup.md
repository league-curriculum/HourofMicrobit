# Setup Your Arcade

Now lets load Bunny Hop onto our Micro:bit. Select one of the three game
controllers, then visit the [Bunny Hop](https://makecode.com/_XqaVLig0x5Cx) 
program. Click on the "Edit Code" button at the top of the screen to edit the code. 

Unfortunately, loading programs onto the arcade isn't always as easy as it is
with the other Micro:bit programs. For the Arcade, when you click "download"
button, it will download a file to your computer, and you will have to drag
that file into the USB drive created by plugging in the Micro:bit


## Load a Game

To load Bunny Hop on your console you should first select the hardware you
are using in the editor:

* Plug in the console to your computer. You should see a new drive available called "MICROBIT" or "ARCADE-F4"
* In the bottom-left of the Makecode Arcade editor, click on the '...' icon to select the hardware. 
* In the hardware, select the picture of the console you have. 

::: warning

If you don't see the Micro:bit drive (  "MICROBIT" or"ARCADE-F4" ) you might
have to reset the console. Look for a small button or switch. On the Meowbit
the button is on the right side under the orange rubber case and on the blue
Retro it is the small button in front. 

:::

You should see either a game screen, or a blue and purple loading screen. You
might have to turn on a switch on the console if you don't see the screen.

Second, you will need to load the code onto the console. Click the '...' icon
again, and you will get this popup again: 

<div class="centered-image"><img src="./select_hardware.png" width="600px"></div>

On the Meowbit you should see the "connect device" option. Select this and you
will be able to download directly to the Meowbit console. But for the other
two consoles, you will have to download the file to the computer. 

If you don't have the 'connect device' option when you click "Download" your
browser will download a file to the computer. When it is done downloading,
drag the file to the "MICROBIT" drive.
