# Arcade

You can program video games on your Microbit, using specialized hardware that
looks like a portable game console. We use three different consoles, but 
the one we like best is the Meobit, so we have the most of them.

This device is a controller and screen for a Micro:bit; you will need to have a microbit to plug into it.

This handheld console looks a lot like the one your parents played as kids, but it has a Micro:bit inside of it. 


## Kittenbot Meowbit

The Meowbit is also a Micro:bit with a screen and buttons, but it also has a
connector under the white cover, so you can plug it into robots like a
regular Microbit. 

## Programming the Arcade

To Program these devices, you will need a different version of Makecode,
[Makecode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com). 

## Example Games

Here is a [large collection of Makecode games](https://github.com/makecode-extensions/arcade-games/tree/master)
that you can download and install. However, you will probably need some help form an instructor
to get them working.
